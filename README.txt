Our git broke, so I had to download previous commits and piece everything together. I've uploaded the working demo from the presentation, we were not able to piece all the activities together.. there are still some conflicts, e.g., something went wrong with piecing Mohammed's user-related activities from sprint 1 with our sprint 2 activities. Either Mohammed changed something or someone has uploaded some conflicting code... Hard to pinpoint what's exactly gone wrong..


On Launch, the build will take you directly to the the dashboard. From the dashboard you can open up the Browse, Scheduler, and ShoppingList  activities (The edit account button won't take you anywhere). The shopping list and Schedule have been pre-loaded, because we did not complete the scheduling feature from within the View Recipe Activity. The recipes have been loaded from our Firestore database.


If you go to the manifests, you can see there's a commented out activity block which lets you begin from the user sign in/registration activities. 
It looks as though Tim must have overwritten Mohammed's drawables for the username/password fields.


Thanks,
